"Two teams battle for laughs and points as they make up scenes, games and songs on the spot, in the spirit of TV¡¯s Whose Line Is It Anyway? A referee governs the action, calling fouls and keeping the match moving at a blistering pace.  An average of seven to 12 games are played during a ComedySportz match, drawn from a list of over a hundred improv games.  Every match is different, with different players, different games and different audiences supplying new suggestions.  The fans judge the games and ultimately decide the winners and losers.  ComedySportz also asks willing volunteers to join for a game or two each match."
